My experience is primarily in MSP environments - Over past couple years I’ve worked across on-prem, cloud, and hybrid infrastructure in various contexts, supporting enterprises and SMEs. My work has spanned several fields, including critical infrastructure, legal, accounting, civil engineering, and education. I regularly assist with on-site tasks such as network upgrades, cloud migrations, and ongoing infrastructure support.

My career began at a local repair shop when I was 14, I honed my technical skills by troubleshooting and repairing hardware, from iPhones to consumer desktops. Since then, I’ve supported clients in diverse environments, providing hardware support, writing documentation, and managing backup and disaster recovery operations.

This website serves as my digital portfolio. I intend to occasionally share writeups about what I’m learning and other projects I find interesting.
