# Clay Townsend - Network Engineer

All content on this site is written and edited in Markdown using Obsidian. From there, plain text files are automatically compiled into web pages using Jekyll and hosted with Github Pages.

Jekyll is a static site generator that takes markdown files and generates static HTML. It’s simple, fast, and ideal for a personal blog or website because there’s no need for server-side processing or databases. All content is version-controlled in Git, and you can push updates with ease.

GitHub Pages is used for hosting. It’s free and directly integrates with GitHub, so any push to the repository automatically triggers a rebuild and deployment of the site. This setup provides a seamless workflow where I can write markdown posts and deploy them with minimal effort.

Obviously, this setup is tailored specifically for me,  you can easily replicate something similar using any Jekyll theme you desire. i opted to use [jekyll-shell-theme](https://github.com/itstorque/jekyll-shell-theme)
